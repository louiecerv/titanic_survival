titanic.csv refer to the provided dataset.  Create a streamlit app that would load the dataset as a dataframe from the csv file.  The app will perform preprocessing tasks: check for null values. if null values are found replace with the mean (for numeric values).  check for outliers.  check for consistent data type for inputs. display the dataframe. show statistics. list numeric columns and categorical columns. use one hot encoding for columns Sex and Embarked.  The last column 'Survived' is the target. Apply standard scaling for all the columns after encoding. Label encode the target. use the scikit-learn library.  Be sure to reverse the label encoding when computing the predicted values. Run the following models logistic regression, naive bayes, SVM, decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting and KNN.  Split the dataset and use 20 percent for testing. Create tabs and in each tab show the following: confusion matrix of the model, classification report, a short remark on the model performance. Use matplotlib and seaborn to enhance the appearance of the confusion matrix and classification report. Give me the full python code.
